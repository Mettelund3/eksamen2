        <h3 class="h3karre">1. Semester Assignment</h3>
        <p class="beskrivelse1k">Make an interactive installation</p>
        <p class="beskrivelse1k">We did a project with Fjord&Bælt with an interactive installation</p>
        <p class="ktekst">We had a cooperation with Fjord&Bælt in Kerteminde, Denmark. We got challenged to make an interactive installation for their museum that hit their target group of kids' families and would make the customers spend more time at their museum. We started the project with making groups and then we had a visit at their museum and we also had a visit as a group at a center in Vejle called Økolariet, because we got told that they had some interactive installations made by former multimedia design students and we also got lucky and had an interview with the project manager at their place. </p>
        <p class="ktekst">Our purpose with our assignment was about making death a none scary thing for kids and tell them that death for one animal means food for another animal. After our field research we began to do some desk research about other places around the world with interactive installations. We had a deadline of 14 days, where we needed to pitch 3 ideas to Fjord&Bælt and get feedback on them and then choose one to work on fully. The 3 ideas can be seen down below. We went with the box which stimulates the senses because you get to touch stuff, and watch an animation movie and hear some instructions at the same time. </p>
        <p class="ktekst">We ended up with a functional prototype with 5 animation movies which you could click on to start each. In each movie you get an instruction to do something with the box. In 4 of the movies you get an instruction to feel something in the 4 holes in the box where there was something related to the videos. We also chose to give the characters in the movies names, so the kids could get a feeling of the animals being personalized.  </p>
